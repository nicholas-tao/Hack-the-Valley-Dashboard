# SpotiFinder-Frontend

## Inspiration
On this Valentine's Day, we have decided to help people come together through their mutual taste in musical arts. Not only does music suggest a lot about one's personality, it also helps people bond over their similar interests in songs.

## What it does
It uses the Spotify API to get data from the user, such as the songs in their playlists. It then initiates an algorithm to start matchmaking that finds other users with similar interests and presents your top matches,

## How I built it
The front-end of the application has been built with ReactJS, CSS and HTML5. The back-end has been built upon NodeJS and deals with the Spotify API enabling functionality, such as user authentication. The algorithm analyses the user's playlist and compares it with other users to produces rankings of the matches in terms of match percentage.

## Challenges I ran into
It was our first time using ReactJS and NodeJS, so we faced many challenges (ie npm start didn't work). The greatest challenge was in getting the frontend and backend to communicate.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Team members were able to collaborate, quickly build team cohesion and cram out a new language syntax. We were able to generate several innovative ideas and settle on the most future promising project, SpotiFinder.

## What I learned
Using get and push to call API and filter the useful API results. Generate login page and authorization credentials using Javascript and HTML/CSS. We learned a lot about React and Node as well.

## What's next for SpotiFinder
Including messaging functionality and converting it to a mobile app.
